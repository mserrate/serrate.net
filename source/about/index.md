My name is Marçal Serrate and I’m a technical architect specialized in enterprise solutions and software design.

I have been working on national and international projects applying SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS and NoSQL on the .NET & JVM platforms. I also enjoy working on BigData technologies such as Storm, Kafka, Hadoop & Cassandra.

I’ve been performing the **Udi Dahan’s Enterprise Development with NServiceBus** workshop several times in the past.
